            <h3>Cut Water Waste</h3>
            <li><b>Use less water</b>: one of the clearest steps toward water conservation is also the most obvious one -- simply use less. </li>
            <li><b>Start by taking shorter showers,</b> filling up the dishwasher and laundry machines before you run them, and turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth. </li>
            <li><b>Check for leaks:</b> look at faucets and pipes to make sure water isn?t escaping.</li>
            <li><b>Go meatless:</b> it takes 4,000 to 18,000 gallons of water to produce one burger because of the food, water and facilities that cows need. By reducing meat in your diet, you can drastically cut down on not only water use but greenhouse gas emissions as well.</li>
            <li><b>Go renewable:</b> Half of the water we use goes to power generation. Renewable sources like solar and wind use significantly less water than coal and nuclear.</li>

            <h3>Eliminate E-waste</h3>
            <li><b>Buy refurbished cell phones.</b> These previously owned, good-as-new cell phones approved by the manufacturer save hundreds of pounds of mined products that go into making circuit boards. </li>
            <li><b> Recycle your old cell phones. </b> Cellular phone stores are increasingly taking otherwise trashed cell phones and recycling their insides to reduce the need for new materials.</li>
            <li><b> Recycle or refill empty ink cartridges. </b> Getting your cartridges refilled can save you a lot of money, as this usually costs about half the price of a new cartridge. Many stores are also taking in empty cartridges to recycle.  </li>
            <li><b>Repair instead of replace.</b>Repair broken parts of electronic devices as often as possible instead of replacing the item all together.</li>

            <h3>Go Solar</h3>
            <li> Assess whether solar energy is the right choice for your home. </li>
            <li> <b>Determine if your roof</b> has adequate sun exposure  </li>
            <li> <b>Consider leasing.</b> If it is out of your budget to purchase a solar system, you could consider about leasing one. </li>
            <li> <b>Opt for a grid-tied system. </b>Keeping it ?grid-tied? will allow you to sell your excess energy and adds a built-in safety net of stored energy in case you need a little extra. </li>

            <h3>Reduce Your Paper Waste</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Copy on both sides of the paper.</b> This is especially efficient for internal documents and drafts. </li>
                <li><b>Reduce documents to fit two pages onto one.</b> Use for circulating rough drafts or file copies of documents. </li>
                <li><b>Use lighter weight paper.</b> Lighter paper requires less energy and fewer raw materials when it's manufactured. </li>
                <li><b>Find alternatives to mail.</b> Use email, voice mail and fax modem transmissions whenever possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stop Junk Mail</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Set a goal of <b>ZERO mail!</b> </li>
                <li><b>To stop delivery of yellow pages</b></li>
                <li>Your credit card company probably sells your name the most often. <b>Call and ask them to stop.</b> </li>
                <li><b>Eliminate unnecessary subscriptions.</b> Cancel newspapers, newsletters and magazines you don't read or can access online. Take your name off mailing lists to reduce junk mail.</li>

            <h3>Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Drive a fuel-efficient car.</b> If your new car gets 10 mpg more than your old one, you can reduce CO2 emissions by 2,500 pounds a year.</li>
                <li><b>Walk, bike, car pool or use mass transit.</b> If you leave your car at home two days a week, you'll reduce CO2 emissions by 1,590 pounds a year.</li>
                <li><b>Use energy-efficient appliances.</b> If you replaced your existing refrigerator with a high-efficiency model, you'd reduce your CO2 emissions by 220 pounds a year. Energy-efficient appliances are now available for microwave ovens, stoves, dishwashers and computers, as well.</li>
                <li><b>Reduce, reuse and...Recycle? You guessed it.</b> Buying food and other products in reusable or recyclable packaging can reduce CO2 emissions by 230 pounds a year, while recycling all of your home's waste newsprint, cardboard, glass and metal can reduce emissions an additional 850 pounds a year</li>
